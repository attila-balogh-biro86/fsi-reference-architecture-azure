# FSI reference architecture based on C64 and Azure AKS reference architecture

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to design a scalable and secure online banking platform that supports account management, payments, user authentication, and audit logging. The solution should ensure high availability, modular design, and extensibility for future services.

### High availability and backup

1. Design for Multi-Region Redundancy
   
![aks-multi-cluster](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf98cce0-50a3-4598-84ae-e1d826554916)

How:

- Multiple AKS cluster deployments in different regions.
- Front Door configuration: we can add both clusters to the same backend pool
- Leverage health probes (HTTP/HTTPS) at the service level (e.g., /healthz (Spring Boot actuator)) so Front Door routes traffic only to healthy clusters.
- It can be considered to build an active-active scenario to minimize latency or an active-passive setup for disaster recovery

2. Zone Redundancy within Each Region

How:

- Leverage AKS with availability zones enabled, which helps eliminate the risk of region outage.
- Node pools should spread across different availability zones.
- Leverage a zone redundant load balancer (Standard SKU) for the AKS microservice layer (Kubernetes Service type).


3. Application-Level Resilience

How:

- Leverage Kubernetes Deployments with replicas spread across zones.

- Enable PodDisruptionBudgets to avoid too many pods going down during maintenance.

- Implement liveness and readiness probes so Front Door sees unhealthy pods and routes traffic elsewhere.

- Store state in redundant services (Azure SQL, Redis with geo-replication).

4. Networking and Failover Mechanisms

How:

- We can expose AKS services via Azure Public Load Balancer (Standard SKU) or Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller â€” these become the backend for Front Door.

- Private Link if needed for security, but be aware of failover complexity.

- Keep DNS TTLs low if we need to fallback to DNS-based routing


### Authentication and authorization

### Audit logging requirement

The system needs to be able to log critical business events in a strongly consistent manner.
This involves implementing an append-only audit log, which can be a basis for future audits as well.
For this purpose, the main idea is to leverage Azure Confidential Ledger with the corresponding Java SDK.

### Compliance requirements

The following compliance requirements can arise based on the initial problem statements:

- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- PSD2
- ISO27001
- SOX (Within US)
